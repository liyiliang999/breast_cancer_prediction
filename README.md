# Breast Cancer Prediction
Malignant tumors that occur in the glandular epithelium of the breast are called breast cancers, which are cancers that develop from breast tissue. Breast cancer has now become a relatively common tumor that threatens women's physical and mental health.

Although breast cancer is the most common gynecological cancer, most breast lumps are not cancer. In fact, more than 80 percent of breast lumps end up being benign. However, can we identify breast cancer from a breast lump?

I developed an analysis and prediction algorithm to predict breast cancer using data obtained from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29

Data can be viewed through Streamlit dashboard: https://share.streamlit.io/liyiliang999/breast_cancer_prediction/main/app.py
